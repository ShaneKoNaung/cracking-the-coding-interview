'''
Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return
the interÂ­secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference
not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same
node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are
intersecting.
